To create a new benchmark for the DLLite-Plugin proceed as follows:

1. Create a copy of the folder "template"
2. Provide your problem encoding as HEX-program "program.hex";
   in this program, use the constant OWLONTOLOGY (without quotes)
   to refer to the owl-file containing the ontology. The scripts will
   automatically replace this constant by the name of a
   concrete instance.
3. Provide your ontology IN TWO PARTS:
   - ontology_header.owl must contain the part of the owl file
     which should come before the Abox assertions;
   - ontology_footer.owl must contain the part of the owl file
     which should come after the Abox assertions.
4. Edit the script "generate.sh" and list the concepts and roles from
   your ontology at the top.
5. Make sure that the folder "instances" exists and run

     ./generateset.sh i1 i2 i3 p1 p2 p3 c

   where i1 is the minimal instance size (number of individuals)
         i2 is the maximal instance size (number of individuals)
         i3 is the step size between instance sizes

         p1 is the minimal role assertion probability*
         p2 is the minimal role assertion probability
         p3 is the step size between role assertion probabilities

         c is the number of instances for every combination of size
           and role assertion probability

   For instance,

     ./generateset.sh 10 100 10 2 10 2 100

   creates 100 instances for each number of individuals
   from {10, 20, ..., 100} and each role assertion probability
   from {2, 4, ..., 10}.


* The role assertion probability p specifies for a given
  pair (ci, cj) of individuals and role R the probability, that
  (exactly) one of the assertions R(ci, cj) or -R(ci, cj) is added
  to the Abox.
  Thus, with higher p the "connectivity" of the Abox increases.
