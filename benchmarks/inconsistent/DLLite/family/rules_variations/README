For generation of instances with varying size of the rules one needs to run the following command:

./generateset_rules.sh p1 p2 p3 p4 

where p1 is the starting probability, p2 final probability, p3 step between probabilities, p4 number of instancess to be generated for each probability.

Example:
./generateset_rules.sh 5 60 5 10

The ontology data part is fixed in this case to 50 children (male, female and parent relations are proportional).
The datapart of the program is fixed, it has been randomly generated apriori. For each hasParent(X,Y) with Male(Y) present in the ontology it contains a conflicting fact ischildOf(X,Z), s.t. \neg Male(Z) is not known by the ontology with probability 0.35.
